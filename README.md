# 📊 UCI Adult Income Dataset – Student ML Project

This project was created as part of the course **"Statistical Methods for Data Mining"** at the University of Piraeus.  
The goal was to explore the classic UCI Adult Income dataset using techniques from machine learning, data preprocessing, clustering and neural networks.

## 📌 Project Tasks

The work was divided into 5 parts:

1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
   - Handling missing values  
   - Feature transformation  
   - Normalization & encoding  
   - PCA dimensionality reduction  

2. **Feature Selection & Outlier Detection**  
   - Chi-squared ranking  
   - IQR method  
   - Boxplots & winsorization  

3. **Clustering**  
   - K-Means & BIRCH  
   - PCA-based visualization (2D & 3D)  
   - Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) for evaluation  

4. **Classification with Scikit-learn**  
   - Random Forest  
   - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
   - GridSearchCV parameter tuning  
   - Confusion matrix & classification report  

5. **Classification with Keras (Neural Networks)**  
   - Fully connected MLP  
   - EarlyStopping  
   - Train/Validation/Test split  
   - Accuracy, loss curves
